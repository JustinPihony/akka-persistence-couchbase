# Releasing
		
You will need permission in sonatype to push to `com.lightbend.akka` groupd ID.
 
 1. Ask someone in the Akka team to rename the 'akka-persistence-couchbase-xx-stable' report in [WhiteSource](https://saas.whitesourcesoftware.com) to reflect the latest version (unfortunately this requires permissions that cannot be shared in a granular way)
 1. Check [closed issues without a milestone](https://github.com/akka/akka-persistence-couchbase/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aissue%20is%3Aclosed%20no%3Amilestone) and either assign them the 'upcoming' release milestone or 'invalid'
 1. Create a [new release](https://github.com/akka/akka-persistence-couchbase/releases/new) with:
     * the next tag version (e.g. `v0.21`)
     * title and release description including notable changes
     * link to the [milestone](https://github.com/akka/akka-persistence-couchbase/milestones) showing an overview of closed issues for this release
     * overview of contributors generated by [`sbt-authors`](https://github.com/2m/authors)
 1. Travis CI will start a [CI build](https://travis-ci.org/akka/akka-persistence-couchbase/builds) for the new tag and publish artifacts to Bintray.
     * When the travis build fails it must be restarted. Artifacts may already have been pushed to Bintray, however, so remove them there before restarting the build.
 1. Login to [Bintray](https://bintray.com/akka/maven/akka-persistence-couchbase) and sync artifacts to Maven Central:
     * Go to the 'Maven Central' tab and use your sonatype credentials. This can take a long time (you can check https://oss.sonatype.org/#stagingRepositories for progress)
 1. Close the milestone for this release and start a new one.
 1. Build docs `docs/paradox` and copy to a directory with the version of the plugin on akka.io, link `current` to that directory
    (follow https://github.com/akka/alpakka-kafka/blob/master/docs/release-train-issue-template.md#publish-docs-to-gustav)
 1. Ask someone in the Akka team to update the [Lightbend Platform supported modules list](https://developer.lightbend.com/docs/lightbend-platform/2.0/supported-modules/) (requires Lightbend private GitHub permission). Only for stable releases, not milestones/RCs.
